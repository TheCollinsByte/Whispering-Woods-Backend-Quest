## Description

Welcome to the Whispering Woods Backend Quest repository, documenting my 6-month immersive experience in Java backend development under the guidance of [Chinmay Anand](https://www.youtube.com/@chinmayanand896) This repository serves as a comprehensive archive of assignments, projects, and personal insights gained throughout the course.

- Assignments: A collection of tasks designed to reinforce core Java concepts and backend development skills.
- Projects: Larger, real-world applications developed to demonstrate the practical application of learned theories.

Notes: Personal observations, explanations, and summaries of key topics covered during the course.

## Course Structure

The course is structured to provide a deep understanding of Java backend development, covering topics such as:

- **Core Java Fundamentals**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, exception handling, and multithreading.
- **Advanced Java Concepts**: Design patterns, Java Collections Framework, and Java 8 features like lambda expressions and streams.
- **Spring Framework**: Introduction to Spring Boot, dependency injection, RESTful web services, and data persistence with Spring Data JPA.
- **Database Management**: Working with relational databases, JDBC, and implementing CRUD operations.
- **Security**: Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms using Spring Security.
- **Testing**: Writing unit and integration tests with JUnit and Mockito.
 

Note: The above topics are indicative and may vary based on the course progression and updates.
